# IDE Review
## An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
## An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. 
## IDEs are designed to maximize programmer productivity by providing tight-knit components with similar user interfaces. 
## One aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities, instead it provides the same set of capabilities as one cohesive unit.
## Reducing setup time can increase developer productivity, especially in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating and learning all of the individual tools.
